# Quantifying-Cognitive-Effort-s-Impact-on-Suppression-of-Epilepsy-Associated-After-Discharges
This project investigates how cognitive effort influences the suppression of epilepsy-associated after discharges (ADs) in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected during pre-surgical functional brain mapping. Using data from epileptic patients, the code reproduces all preprocessing, analysis, modeling pipelines presented in the paper.

This repository contains the full analysis pipeline used to study how cognitive effort affects the suppression of epilepsy-associated after-discharges.

It includes code to reproduce the paper’s end-to-end workflow:

1)Data loading and preprocessing

2)After-discharge time-window handling and trial segmentation

3)Feature extraction (including DFA / MF-DFA and FODN-based network features)

4)Model training and evaluation (e.g., logistic regression baseline)

5)GUI tools for interactive analysis and batch processing
